# J'Accuse!

## About

You are the world-famous detective Mathilde Camus. Zophie the cat has gone missing, 
and you must sift through the clues. Suspects either always tell lies or always tell 
the truth. Will you find Zophie the cat in time and accuse the guilty party?

In this game, you take a taxi to different locations around the city. At each location 
is a suspect and an item. You can ask suspects about other suspects and items, compare 
their answers with your own exploration notes, and determine if they are lying or telling 
the truth. Some will know who has catnapped Zophie (or where she is, or what item is 
found at the location of the kidnapper), but you must determine if you can believe them. 
You have five minutes to find the criminal but will lose if you make three wrong accusations. 
This game is inspired by Homestar Runner’s “Where’s an Egg?” game.
